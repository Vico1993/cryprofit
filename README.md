# Cryprofit

Small script to help keep track of my portfolio and some crypto purchase I made

## TODO:

-   Split concern ( clean code )
    -   Find a better way to structure file to split concern
-   Add testing with Jest
    -   Add github action to run test / lint
-   Add input validation
-   Be able to read CSV report from Coinbase and Crypto.com
